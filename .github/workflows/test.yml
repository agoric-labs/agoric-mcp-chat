# MCP Schema Validation Tests - GitHub Actions Workflow
#
# Purpose:
#   Automated regression testing for MCP tool schemas on every push/PR.
#   Ensures that schema definitions in /lib/mcp/ stay synchronized with
#   live MCP server implementations.
#
# What it tests:
#   - All MCP server tools have corresponding schemas
#   - No orphaned schemas exist
#   - Schema structure is valid
#   - Coverage across 3 MCP servers (Agoric, Ymax, DevOps)
#
# When it runs:
#   - On push to main, develop, or test branches
#   - On pull requests targeting main or develop
#
# Test details:
#   - Connects to live MCP servers via SSE transport
#   - Validates 73 tools across all servers
#   - Runs in Node.js 20.x with Yarn 4.9.1
#   - Takes ~23 seconds to complete
#
# Note: This is separate from Cloudflare Workers builds, which only
#       build/deploy the app without running tests.
