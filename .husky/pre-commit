# Pre-commit Hook: Run MCP Schema Validation Tests
#
# Purpose:
#   Ensures all MCP tool schemas are validated before code is committed.
#   This prevents schema drift and catches missing/orphaned schemas early.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Local commits: Runs all tests via 'yarn test:run'
#   - CI environments (Cloudflare, etc.): Skips tests to prevent deployment failures
#
# Why skip in CI?
#   CI environments set the $CI variable. We skip here because:
#   1. GitHub Actions has a dedicated test workflow (.github/workflows/test.yml)
#   2. Cloudflare Workers builds should only build/deploy, not test
#   3. Tests are not appropriate during the 'yarn install' prepare phase
#
# Note: This only affects git hooks. Explicit test commands (yarn test:run) still work.

[ -n "$CI" ] && echo "Skipping tests in CI environment (tests run via GitHub Actions)" && exit 0

# Run tests before allowing commit
yarn test:run
